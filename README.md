# Stylestagram
Recommending pants by your fit

## Introduction
As the online shopping market grows, many people buy clothes online, but when they try to buy clothes online, there is a risk of size rather than trying them on yourself. If it doesn't fit after ordering, you can return it, but this takes a lot of time. So, I thought about the function of receiving the user's size from the beginning, comparing it with the size of the clothes, and providing the recommended size accordingly, and implemented it.

## Recommendation
Stylestargram shows clothes that matches to userâ€™s pyhsical size. And all of the reviews they see are reviews of the other users who have similar size with the user. These kind of recommendation algorithm is in our backend server as a form of api so that we can further apply more tech and optimization to these apis such as machine learning.
