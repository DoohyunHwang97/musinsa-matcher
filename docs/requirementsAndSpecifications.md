# Stylestagram

## Project Requirements and Specification

### 15/10/2022, Rev. 1.0 - initial version

### Project Abstract

Stylestagram project is focusing on providing a solution to growing size issues in online fashion commerce market. And It also provides the multiple choice of fashion styles to the users to let them choose the styles they want and to get provided with the various clothes options which fit them well and match their style preferences. Furthermore, users can upload their reviews which are shared to other users with similar body shape. If the service secures the sufficient users, we woould provide the environment where they can chat, follow and upload feeds just like instagram so that users can communicate with their styles each other.

### Customer

Our specific target in this project is the 20-29 aged males who uses online fashion commerce in South Korea which is 97.2% of the total 20-29 population in South Korea. And if the service grows, we would gradually expand our target customers to 20-29 aged females.

### Competitive Landscape

#### Various solutions for size issue given in fashion commerce platforms

- Matching clothes based on the user's brief body shape informations(height, weight, etc..) and simple questions about body shape
- Providing size prediction by comparing the item with the item the user already has
- Providing multiple expected images of multiple body shapes

The problem is that even if those above give some kind of information about the size, but it's not precise. We use the precise body shape data measured by the tape measure to provide the precise recommendations.

#### Different way of showing items

- Most use the category such as denim pants to show the wanted items
- Styles are sometimes added to help the user to search for the wanted category in preferred style

We suggest the new model which shows the items specifically customized based on the user's body information. Additionally, user can choose the style they want inside the pool of clothings which already satisfy the size match
